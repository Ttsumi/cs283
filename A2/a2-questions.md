## Assignment 2 Questions

#### Directions
Please answer the following questions and submit in your repo for the second assignment.  Please keep the answers as short and concise as possible.

1. In this assignment I asked you provide an implementation for the `get_student(...)` function because I think it improves the overall design of the database application.   After you implemented your solution do you agree that externalizing `get_student(...)` into it's own function is a good design strategy?  Briefly describe why or why not.

    > **Answer**:  I agree that externalizing `get_student(...)` into it's own function is a good design strategy. It removes the need for duplicate code across multiple functions where we may need to get a student to update or delete their information. We can simply use this function to retrieve the student. It removes redundant code, and centralizes the logic of extracting a student. This not only makes the code cleaner, it also makes it more maintainable. If the extraction logic changes, we will simply need to update this one function.

2. Another interesting aspect of the `get_student(...)` function is how its function prototype requires the caller to provide the storage for the `student_t` structure:

    ```c
    int get_student(int fd, int id, student_t *s);
    ```

    Notice that the last parameter is a pointer to storage **provided by the caller** to be used by this function to populate information about the desired student that is queried from the database file. This is a common convention (called pass-by-reference) in the `C` programming language. 

    In other programming languages an approach like the one shown below would be more idiomatic for creating a function like `get_student()` (specifically the storage is provided by the `get_student(...)` function itself):

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t student;
        bool student_found = false;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found)
            return &student;
        else
            return NULL;
    }
    ```
    Can you think of any reason why the above implementation would be a **very bad idea** using the C programming language?  Specifically, address why the above code introduces a subtle bug that could be hard to identify at runtime? 

    > **ANSWER:** Functions have localized environments which means any variable created inside a function goes out of scope when we exit the function. In the given example, student is a local variable and upon exiting the function, it's life-cycle ends, and thus it can exhibit undefined behavior. On the other hand, by providing the storage to the function, we also avoid making copies of the struct.

3. Another way the `get_student(...)` function could be implemented is as follows:

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND or memory allocation error: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t *pstudent;
        bool student_found = false;

        pstudent = malloc(sizeof(student_t));
        if (pstudent == NULL)
            return NULL;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found){
            return pstudent;
        }
        else {
            free(pstudent);
            return NULL;
        }
    }
    ```
    In this implementation the storage for the student record is allocated on the heap using `malloc()` and passed back to the caller when the function returns. What do you think about this alternative implementation of `get_student(...)`?  Address in your answer why it work work, but also think about any potential problems it could cause.  
    
    > **ANSWER:** It will work because we are manually allocating memory, and thus it will persist even after exiting the function. However, it is risky and unsafe because this memory will have to be freed later. And also, the re-usuability of the function is risky since every call to the function will allocate memory.   


4. Lets take a look at how storage is managed for our simple database. Recall that all student records are stored on disk using the layout of the `student_t` structure (which has a size of 64 bytes).  Lets start with a fresh database by deleting the `student.db` file using the command `rm ./student.db`.  Now that we have an empty database lets add a few students and see what is happening under the covers.  Consider the following sequence of commands:

    ```bash
    > ./sdbsc -a 1 john doe 345
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 128 Jan 17 10:01 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 3 jane doe 390
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 256 Jan 17 10:02 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 63 jim doe 285 
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 64 janet doe 310
    > du -h ./student.db
        8.0K    ./student.db
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 4160 Jan 17 10:03 ./student.db
    ```

    For this question I am asking you to perform some online research to investigate why there is a difference between the size of the file reported by the `ls` command and the actual storage used on the disk reported by the `du` command.  Understanding why this happens by design is important since all good systems programmers need to understand things like how linux creates sparse files, and how linux physically stores data on disk using fixed block sizes.  Some good google searches to get you started: _"lseek syscall holes and sparse files"_, and _"linux file system blocks"_.  After you do some research please answer the following:

    - Please explain why the file size reported by the `ls` command was 128 bytes after adding student with ID=1, 256 after adding student with ID=3, and 4160 after adding the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** Each student record is 64 bytes. Since we are skipping the first (0) index, we start at index 1. So after adding a student with ID 1, our file size is (64 * 2) = 128 bytes. When we add a student with ID 3, we are essentially creating a gap for index 2, filled with 0's, and then moving on to the correct index for ID 3. So, we have 2 valid records and 2 empty records, so our file size is (64 * 4) = 256 bytes. Similarly, for student with ID 64, we create gaps/holes in the file, until we reach that offset index. So, the file size after adding student with ID 64 becomes (64 * 64) = 4096.

    -   Why did the total storage used on the disk remain unchanged when we added the student with ID=1, ID=3, and ID=63, but increased from 4K to 8K when we added the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** Linux filesystem memory allocation works with pages where each page is about 4K bytes. So initially, the OS gives us 1 page to work with, and as we popuplate the db file with students whose ID-1, and ID=3, and ID=63. However, when we add student with ID=64, we require more than one page of memory which linux gave us which has about 4K bytes. Now, the OS gives us yet another page of memory to work with. This is why for the first three additions, the storage used on the disk remain unchanged but increased from 4K to 8K when we added student with ID=64. 

    - Now lets add one more student with a large student ID number  and see what happens:

        ```bash
        > ./sdbsc -a 99999 big dude 205 
        > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 6400000 Jan 17 10:28 ./student.db
        > du -h ./student.db
        12K     ./student.db
        ```
        We see from above adding a student with a very large student ID (ID=99999) increased the file size to 6400000 as shown by `ls` but the raw storage only increased to 12K as reported by `du`.  Can provide some insight into why this happened?

        > **ANSWER:**  This happens because the OS thinks we are asking for more memory than we need, and it tries to be smart about how much resource it allocates to us since the OS needs to be efficient and save memory for other programs as well. So when we add a student with a much larger ID, the sparse file handling of Linux filesystems, stores the metadata of the empty regions, but does allocate space for the empty regions. The logical file size includes the gaps and thus `ls -l` shows the file size to be 6400000 but the actual disk usage as seen by `du` is only reported at 12k.
